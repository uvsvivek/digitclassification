Convolution neural networks digit classification for mnist dataset
mnist dataset is database of handwritten digits commonly used for handwritten image classification/processing .
In my code i have used 2 convolution layers one dense layer and activation function relu for input and Softmax at the outpu
to train my model the accuracy is pretty good . i save my trained model with the extention (.h5) so that it save the weights,architecture,traning configuration
I have created GUI interface which helps me to draw the digits on muy screen and i have tried to predict the digit with the help of model i have trained 
the screenshots are attached
